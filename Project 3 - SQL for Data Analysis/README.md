# Project Overview:

This project was about the exploration of a Digital Music Store Database, in which SQL queries had to be run and visualizations were made to showcase the queries output. 

## There will be two parts to this project.

* The first part is a series of questions that will assure the mastering of the main concepts taught during the SQL part of the Advanced Data Analysis degree by Udacity.
* The second part is a presentation. Have the ability to be creative in the questions you ask. Write a SQL query to pull the data needed to answer the question successfully. Use the pulled data to build a visual that answers your question. To review the presentation, save slides as a **PDF**.

## Requirements
* DB Browser for SQLite.
* Matplotlib or Seaborn using Jupyter Notebook.
* Question sets (SQL Project Question Sets.pdf)
