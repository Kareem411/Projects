## Project 1 : US Bikeshare Data
[Project Submission Link](https://github.com/yogi1510/Post-your-Work-on-GitHub/tree/master/Project-2%20Python)

### Overview:

In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Wrote code to import the data & answer interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics. Wrote a script that took raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. Filters the information by city, month and weekday, to visualize statistical information related to a subset of the data. The user is able to chose to view raw data and to sort it by columns, in an ascending or descending order.
