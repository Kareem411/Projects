[Project Submission Link](https://github.com/Kareem411/Projects/tree/main/Project%201-%20%20Bikeshare%20Data)

### Overview:

In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Wrote code to import the data & answer interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics. Wrote a script that took raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. Filters the information by city, month and weekday, to visualize statistical information related to a subset of the data. The user is able to chose to view raw data and to sort it by columns, in an ascending or descending order.

## Project 2 : Investigate a Dataset
[Project Submission Link](https://github.com/Kareem411/Projects/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20Investigate%20a%20Dataset)

### Overview:

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier

This data set(TMDB Movie Data) contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. 

● Certain columns, like ‘cast’
and ‘genres’, contain multiple
values separated by pipe (|)
characters.

● There are some odd characters
in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry
about cleaning them. You can
leave them as is.

● The final two columns ending
with “_adj” show the budget and
revenue of the associated movie
in terms of 2010 dollars,
accounting for inflation over time.
